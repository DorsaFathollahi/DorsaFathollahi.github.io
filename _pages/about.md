I am currently a final year undergraduate computer science student at the Sharif University of Technology. In fall I will join Stanford University EE department for my graduate studies.

My main areas of interest are distributed algorithms (generally algorithms), coding theory, information theory, and security related areas. I am currently focusing on applications of coding theory in distributed computing. Previously I have worked on decoding of Reed-Muller codes, Index Coding problem, Embedded Security, as well as total dominating sets of graphs.
