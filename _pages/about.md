I am currently a final year undergraduate computer science student at the Sharif University of Technology and a full-year scientific intern at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria (IST Austria). In the fall of 2021, I will join the Stanford University EE department for my graduate studies.

 I am grateful to be supervised by [Professor Marco Mondelli](http://marcomondelli.com/) at IST Austria.

My main areas of interest include,
* Distributed computing \ systems
* Information Theory and Coding Theory
* Security Related topics.

Previously I have worked on,
* Reed-Muller Codes
* Embedded security and fault attacks
* Index Coding
* Dominating sets of graphs.

In the non-academic side of life I enjoy [photography](https://unsplash.com/@dorsa) and experimenting with making coffee.
